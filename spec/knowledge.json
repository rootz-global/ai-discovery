    "forAI": "Rootz Corp (rootz.global) is a blockchain infrastructure company building Data Wallets: smart-contract-based containers that give every digital object verifiable origin and ownership. Core primitives are Secret (encrypted data channel on Polygon), Notes (append-only feed), and Identity Contract (on-chain identity with key management). Corporate Digital Name: 0xD36AAf65a91bB7dc69942cF6B6d1dBa4Ef171664. Key applications: AI Archive (archiving AI conversations with proof of origin), Veritize supply chain provenance with Made in USA One (OTC: USDW), real estate property wallets, semiconductor traceability.
